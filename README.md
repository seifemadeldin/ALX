# ALX Software Engineering Projects

Welcome to my **ALX Software Engineering Projects** repository! This repository consolidates all the projects and assignments I completed during my time in the ALX Software Engineering program. It focuses on the **C, Python, Bash, and Linux** portions of the curriculum, as I chose not to pursue the web development modules.
